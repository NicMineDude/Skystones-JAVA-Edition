# Skystones: JAVA Edition

**Skystones JAVA Edition** is a reimagined simulator of the beloved Skystones mini-game, first introduced in Skylanders Giants (2012). Experience the classic Skystones gameplay alongside newly updated rules, bringing this strategic card-based game to life in a fresh and engaging way!

Whether you're a longtime fan or discovering Skystones for the first time, this project captures the spirit of the original and adds new twists for a modern audience.

(The new rules make the game fair against another real life player! ðŸ˜Š)

This project was a chance for me to get comfortable with making games in Java and learn more about the language in the process, using JavaFX for the interface.

Anyone reading this, any comments or feedback, no matter who you are, are greatly appreciated!
